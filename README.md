# vizme
A simple python-based command-line utility to to visualize random blobs of data. It is heavily based on `pixd` made by `FireFly`: https://github.com/FireyFly/pixd

You could consider vizme a python based version of `pixd` with the ability to swap out palettes.

#### Usage
`vizme` is installed as a command-line utility accessible as `vizme` from the command-line.

You can use it to convert random data files to images:

```
-$ vizme 

```

#### Bugs
Feel free to report issues, this 'utility' was build out of ease as I got frustrated with manual conversion of timestamps and strings the whole time.
